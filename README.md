# My website

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects as a future software engineer. The website will feature a clean, modern layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive user experience. It will include sections for my professional summary, education, technical skills, project highlights, and contact information. The goal is to provide an easily accessible, professional, and visually appealing online resume that presents my journey, expertise, and achievements effectively.
